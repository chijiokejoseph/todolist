///
/// - if status == TaskStatus::Active
///     - it reads the list of tasks from 'Active.txt'

/// # Arguments
/// - **tasks_list**: a vector of tasks from which the tasks

/// - **status**: a `TaskStatus` enum that is used to determine
/// the name of the file to write tasks to. This filename is
/// directly linked to the type of tasks being stored.
/// # Returns
/// `Some(())` if the operation completes successfully else `None`.
